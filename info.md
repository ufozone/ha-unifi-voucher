UniFi Hotspot Manager as a Custom Component for Home Assistant.

This integration facilitates user-friendly management of guest Wi-Fi vouchers. By integrating with Home Assistant, users can swiftly and easily generate and display personalized access codes. These vouchers can then be shared with guests, granting temporary access to the Wi-Fi network.

Key features of the integration include:

* **Voucher Creation:** Users can effortlessly generate new access codes, with various configuration options such as validity period and available data volume.
* **Display of Voucher:** The last created voucher is presented in the Home Assistant interface. As soon as the voucher has been used, the next one will be displayed.
* **QR Code Display:** The integration enables the display of a QR code for the guest Wi-Fi, facilitating quick connectivity for guests. Optionally, your own logo can be shown in the QR code.
* **Automation:** The integration can be integrated into existing automations and allows, for example, the time-controlled creation of vouchers.
* **User-Friendliness:** The integration is designed to offer an intuitive user experience, utilizing the Home Assistant interface as a central control center for guest Wi-Fi management.

The UniFi Hotspot Manager Integration provides a practical solution for the temporary provision of Wi-Fi access, seamlessly integrating into the Home Assistant environment for intuitive use.

The most UniFi Network Controller by Ubiquiti Networks, inc., e.g. Cloud Key 2, UDM, UDM Pro are supported.

## Example of use

The voucher can be presented together with the QR code on a lovelace card:

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Requires Home Assistant 2025.10.0 or newer.

### Installation through HACS

Installation using Home Assistant Community Store (HACS) is recommended.

1. If HACS is not installed, follow HACS installation and configuration at <https://hacs.xyz/>.

2. Click the button below or visit HACS and search for "UniFi Hotspot Manager" (make sure no type filter is set).

    [![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=ufozone&repository=ha-unifi-voucher&category=integration)

3. Install the integration.

4. Restart Home Assistant!

5. Make sure that you refresh your browser window too.

### Manual installation

1. Download the `unifi_voucher.zip` file from the repository [release section](https://github.com/ufozone/ha-unifi-voucher/releases).

   Do **not** download directly from the `main` branch.

2. Extract and copy the content into the path `/config/custom_components/unifi_voucher` of your HA installation.

3. Restart Home Assistant!

4. Make sure that you refresh your browser window too.

### Setup integration

Start setup:

* Click this button:

    [![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=unifi_voucher)

* Or use the "Add Integration" in Home Assistant, Settings, Devices & Services and select "UniFi Hotspot Manager".

## Configuration

* All configuration options are offered from the front end.
* For UniFi OS a local-only user needs to be created. A user who uses the Ubiquiti cloud will not work.
* The user needs super admin, site admin or hotspot privileges in order to manage guest vouchers.
* If the name of the WiFi guest network is specified, a QR code is created for the quick connection.
* Your own logo can be integrated into the QR code. Store the logo into your home assistant instance, e.g. `/config/www/`.

    The folder `/config/custom_components/unifi_voucher/` is over written when the integration is updated, store the custom image in another location.
